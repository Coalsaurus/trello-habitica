## [Trello](https://trello.com) Integration with [Habitica](https://habitica.com)
This Power-Up([?](https://trello.com/en/guide/power-up-productivity)) will keep your Trello cards in sync with Habitica. **No coding is required**; just fill in the form and you're all set!

## How to use?
Each Power-Up is associated with a team. Once a Power-Up has been added to a team, it will be available to all of the boards that belong to that team. So [create a team](https://trello.com/en/guide/create-a-team.html) if you don't have one.

To add a new Power-Up to your team, navigate to the [Power-Ups Administration page](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin), choose your team and click **Create a Power-Up**.

Now it's time to fill in the form.

1. First, name your Power-Up.
2. To work properly this Power-Up requires some permissions. Make sure you've checked all of the following:
  * board-buttons
  * callback
  * card-badges
  * card-buttons
  * card-detail-badges
  * list-actions
3. Provide the URL to your Power-Up.
  * The easiest way is to use the url provided below. As a bonus you will receive all upcoming updates without any changes from your side.  
  `https://alexktzk.github.io/trello-habitica`  
  * Or you can fork this repository, publish **gh-pages** branch to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and use your own url.
4. Now you can navigate to one of the boards of the team and activate your Power-Up! You will find it in the **Custom** section.
5. Finally, click the list menu (three dots) and select either "Mark list as Doing" or "Mark list as Done."

## Developing Power Up

Clone the Git repo

```
$ git clone git://github.com/alexktzk/trello-habitica
$ cd trello-habitica
```

Install packages

```
$ npm install
```

### Run

For quick start run:

```
$ npm start
```

It will build the project and run [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to watch and update when any of the files are changed.

### Live testing

In order to test your code directly on the Trello board you should obtain a public url that points to your local web server. I prefer to use [serveo](https://serveo.net/) in this case.

```
$ ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 serveo.net
```

This command will generate a static url for you.

> The subdomain is chosen deterministically based on your IP address, the provided SSH username, and subdomain availability, so you'll often get the same subdomain between restarts. [More](https://serveo.net/#manual)

You can also request a particular subdomain if you don't like the autogenerated one:

```
$ ssh -R my-subdomain:80:localhost:8080 serveo.net
```

Once you've done just grab your public url and pass it to the Power-Up form as **Iframe connector URL**.

### Deploy

```
$ npm run deploy
```

It will create a build from the **master** branch and push it to [Github Pages](<https://pages.github.com/>).
